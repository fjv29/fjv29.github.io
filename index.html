  <h2 id='health'>Health</h2>

    <p> This is the most important aspect of my life I would like to focus on is my health and that includes mental health. If I am not physicallly and mentally able then i won't be able to help anyone else.<div>Click <a href='./health.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to see what that looks like.</div>
    </p>
  <h2 id='family'>Family</h2>    
    <img src='./resources/images/family.jpg' alt='tanjiro and nezuko from demon slayer anime'>
    <p>The second most important aspect in my life is my family. Many people would say that family is most important but I see it differently. I need be able to take care of myself before I can take care of my family and that is because in order to love others you need to be able to love yourself first. Also, to me, family does not mean someone who is related by blood. Family is anyone who I have a relationship with that I know has good intentions for me and my 'family.' (#noteToSelf: don't forget this category is more important than Career. you work to live not live to work.)<div> Click <a href='./family.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to see what that looks like</div>
    </p>
  <h2 id='career'>Career</h2>
    <img src='https://www.animationcareerreview.com/files/images/articles/careerprofile700_7.jpg' alt='the word career with relating symbols surrounding it'>
    <p>The third most important aspect in my life is my Career. Career as third most important is a bit complex to explain but I'll try my best. It's hard not to rank Career higher because as I develop my Career it allows me the potential to increase my income. Increasing my income will grant me access to resources that can be used to take care of my health and my family. However if my health is in decline and i have poor family relationships then i highly doubt i will be able to focus and make much progress in my career which is why I rank health and family above career.<div>Click <a href='./career.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to see what that looks like.</div>
    </p>
  <h2 id='dreams'>Dreams/Living</h2>
    <img src='https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/surreal-paintings-jacek-yerka-fb__700.jpg'>
    <p>As I reach the final important aspect in my life, i think to myself,'honestly all four aspects are almost equally important' and once again i find putting it last difficult. To keep simple career is above dreams because racecars are expensive! It is important visualize your dreams in great detail because without them there is no growth or progress towards them. The way I like to think about it is, if you can design your ideal world what would it look like?<div>Click <a href='./dreams.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to see what that looks like.</div></p>
